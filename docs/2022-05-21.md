# Working on a Custom Deck of Cards #1 🃏

### Why I am Doing This ❓
Why not? I mean, just the thought of having a physical something made by **you** is an amazing feeling in my opinion. I get to work on a new form of project and also, I can use this project as an excuse to improve my art.

### What Inspired Me? 🤔
<!-- During the development of the Tamagochi game, my friends and I decided to print a dress-up sticker set of the dog with some in-game clothing. And that re-embarked my obsession with physical copies of projects I work on. Throughout my high school years, I used to print out some of the drawings I made onto sticker paper, and give them to my friends. This time I am planning on making a deck of cards with drawings of my own. -->

This whole idea of making my own card deck arose when I started playing card games such as **Uno** more often.
Another factor that helped me is during the development of the Tamagochi game, my friends and I decided to print a dress-up sticker set of the dog with some in-game clothing. And with that my passion for for physical objects of projects I work on was re-embarked.

But before I actually decided on a card game however, I thought about printing a custom laptop sticker, but I quickly scrapped that idea because, it would just ruin the aesthetic of my laptop and I had already printed more than enough stickers in the past.
After spending more time thinking about what I could possibly bring into the real-world, I thought about working on my own card deck. Reason being, they are cheap to produce and I just needed to draw a crap load of characters. 

<br/>

As for what I was going to draw, I first thought about drawing original characters, however in my case, I prefer drawing a different character every time I draw something new, hence I never settle on a character that I can actually call 'original'. With this issue on hand, I decided to draw the cast of Higurashi characters. You might ask; "But why?", and I genuinely have no clue why, maybe it's because I'm too invested in the story for the past few months, or maybe it's because I can't think of any other characters to draw about.

### Current Progress 📊
The deck will consist a set of 52+1 playing cards and a joker card. In total 13+1 characters. Each character except the joker will be printed 4 times. 

<br/>

So far, I roughly sketched out 4 characters, these include;

|🂡 Ace          |🂮 King           |🂫 Jack           |🂭 Queen      |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
|![Mion][mion]  |![Satoko][satoko]|![Hanyuu][hanyuu]|![Rika][rika]|
|Sonozaki Mion  |Houjou Satoko    |Hanyuu           |Furude Rika  |

**Note: The images are cropped, the original resolution is around 1200x2000.**

<br/>

I am also planning on adding characters such as;

|🂢 (Card of 2)|🂣 (Card of 3)|🂤 (Card of 4)|🂥 (Card of 5)|🂦 (Card of 6)|🂧 (Card of 7)|🂨 (Card of 8)|🂩 (Card of 9)|🂪 (Card of 10)|🃏 (Joker)|
|---------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|Maebara Keiichi|Ryuuguu Rena|Takano Miyo|Tomitake Jirou|Kuraudo Oiishi|Akasaka Mamoru|Chie Rumiko|Sonozaki Shion|Houjou Satoshi|Sonozaki Oryou|

<br/>

The card each character will represent is already decided, but I might tweak some of them before the printing phase.

### Other Requirements 📝
At the moment I am planning on making the cards the size of mini playing cards, the reason being, that they are smaller and more portable than regular poker cards.
And so I searched around the internet until stumbled upon this amazing **[playing card template](https://www.magicianmasterclass.com/post/playing-card-template)** that provides high-quality card templates.

For the choice of materials, I settled on, **350gr paper with rounded edges, matte coated surface, and size of 5.4cm x 8cm**.

As for casing, my initial plan was to have a standard paper box, but one of my friends suggested that I use a custom printed plastic case instead. With that thought in mind I found some outstanding free 3D printable models from **[Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en)**. Additionally, I will edit the model of my choice to engrave a custom Higurashi logo on it.

### Afterword
I wasn't planning on writing another blog post so soon and this long, but for some reason, I feel the need to write these, even though I know almost no one except 2 of my friends read them. Even if that is indeed the case I am happy to be able to write these posts on occasion. Thank you once again for reading this blog post, I will probably write another or update this one when I draw more characters. See you later 👋🏻!
